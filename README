= Mozilla Plugin Finder Service (PFS) 2 =

PFS2 is a simple HTTP service intended to:

# Assist in finding a plugins for MIME types whose handling is unknown to the client
# Offer version and security vulnerability data on installed plugins for upgrade recommendations

The server side of PFS2 maintains a database of plugins and plugin releases.
These records are indexed by MIME type, and a set of client application details
that help identify the most appropriate versions of plugins for a given
platform, OS, locale, & etc.

* https://wiki.mozilla.org/PFS2
* lorchard@mozilla.com
* Public URL: TBD
* Source code (in SVN): http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/pfs2/trunk/
* DB Schema (in SVN): http://svn.mozilla.org/projects/pfs2/trunk/conf/schema.sql

== Installation ===

* Requirements
** PHP (both web server and CLI)
** MySQL 5.x
** Memcached

* Create a MySQL database from schema

    mysqladmin -uroot -p create pfs2
    mysql -uroot -p pfs2 -e "grant all privileges on pfs2.* to pfs2@'localhost' identified by 'pfs2';"
    mysql -uroot -p pfs2 < conf/schema.sql

* Update configuration

    cp conf/config.php-dist conf/config.php
    # edit the config file to reflect database and memcache
    vim conf/config.php 

* Update database from plugin definitions

    php bin/update-db.php

* Ensure MySQL and Memcached are running

* Configure Apache's document root to be pfs2/trunk/htdocs

== Request Parameters ==

Queries against PFS2 are performed using HTTP GET, with the following parameters supported:

; mimetype : A space-separated list of mimetypes for a plugin. (Note: space can be encoded as <tt>+</tt> in URLs.)
; clientOS : The client's OS (eg. <tt>navigator.oscpu</tt>, "Windows NT 5.1", "Intel Mac OS X 10.5")
; chromeLocale : The client's locale (eg. <tt>navigator.language</tt>)
; appID : The client's app ID (eg. <tt>navigator.'''???'''</tt> (userAgent?), Firefox is "{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}")
; appRelease : Client app release version (eg.  <tt>navigator.'''???'''</tt> (userAgent?), "3.5.3")
; appVersion : Client's application build version (eg. <tt>navigator.buildID</tt>, "20090824085414")
; callback : Function wrapper for JSON output, (see also: [http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ JSONP technique])

=== Example request === 

Line breaks added for clarity:

    curl -s 'http://dev.pfs2.mozilla.org/?
        mimetype=application/x-shockwave-flash&
        appID=%7Bec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384%7D&
        appVersion=2008052906&
        appRelease=3.5&
        clientOS=mac&
        chromeLocale=ja-JP'

== Response Format ==

The response MIME type for PFS2 is either <tt>application/json</tt>, or
<tt>text/javascript</tt> if the <tt>callback</tt> parameter is non-empty.

The top-level JSON payload is an object pairing plugin identifiers (<tt>pfs_id</tt>s)
each with an object describing a plugin's releases and known aliases.  Note
that the <tt>pfs_id</tt> values are unique only to PFS2, and simply serve as
a way to organize plugins that may change names and other attributes between
releases.

=== Overall structure ===

Plugin descriptions have the following overall structure:

    {
        "adobe-flash-player": {
            "aliases": [ ... ],
            "releases": [ ... ]
        }
    }

=== Plugin name aliases ===

The <tt>aliases</tt> property consists of a list of known names by which the
plugin has been called.  If a value in the list is contained in <tt>/.../</tt>,
that alias is intended to be treated as a regex match.  This list is meant
to assist in identifying installed plugins and matching them with PFS2 results.

For example:

    {
        "adobe-flash-player": {
            "aliases": [
                "/.*Flash.*/", 
                "Adobe Flash Player", 
                "Shockwave Flash"
            ],
            "releases": [ ... ]
        }
    }

=== Plugin release descriptions ===

The <tt>releases</tt> property is an object whose properties are named for
plugin versions, and whose property values are objects describing plugin
releases.  Each of the plugin release description object may some or all of the
following properties:

; pfs_id : <tt>pfs_id</tt> of the plugin within PFS2
; name : Name of the plugin
; vendor : Name of the vendor providing the plugin
; version : A dot-separated normalized version for the plugin, may differ from official vendor versioning scheme in order to maintain internal consistency in PFS2
; guid : A GUID for the plugin release, may differ between releases and platforms (unlike <tt>pfs_id</tt>)
; status : Current status of the release, eg. <tt>latest</tt>, <tt>outdated</tt>, <tt>vulnerable</tt>
; vulnerability_description : For status <tt>vulnerable</tt>, a short description of security vulnerabilities for the plugin release
; vulnerability_url : For status <tt>vulnerable</tt>, a URL detailing security vulnerabilities for the plugin release
; filename : Filename of the plugin as installed
; url : URL with details describing the plugin
; license_url : URL where the license for using the plugin may be found
; manual_installation_url : URL for a manually-launched executable installer for the plugin
; xpi_location : URL for an XPI-based installer for the plugin
; installer_location : URL for an executable installer for the plugin (mainly for Windows)
; installer_hash : A hash of the installer's contents for verifying its integrity
; installer_shows_ui : (0/1) whether or not the installer displays a user interface
; needs_restart : (0/1) whether or not the OS needs to restart after plugin installation
; xpcomabi : '''''(Not sure, inherited from PFS1, need a description)'''''
; min : '''''(Not sure, inherited from PFS1, need a description)'''''
; max : '''''(Not sure, inherited from PFS1, need a description)'''''
; app_release : Client app release for which the plugin is intended (* is wildcard)
; app_version : Client app version for which the plugin is intended (* is wildcard)
; locale : Client app locale for which the plugin is intended (* is wildcard)
; os_name : Client app OS for which the plugin is intended (* is wildcard)
; modified : Timestamp when last the release record was modified
