Plugin definitions in JSON
==========================

This directory contains plugin definitions expressed in JSON.

The top level structure of these JSON files look like so:

{
    "meta": {
    },
    "aliases": {
        "literal": [],
        "regex": []
    },
    "mimes": [
    ],
    "releases": [
    ]
}

The "meta" object is an overall description for the plugin across all of its
releases.

The "releases" array is a list of objects, each of which accepts all of the
properties of the "meta" object.  The intention is that you can describe the
overall properties of releases in "meta", and then override them with releases.

In this way, each release can inherit and reuse the meta properties, but
specify its own property values for version, installation URL, license,
security violations, platform, OS, and etc.  

And finally, the "mimes" list expect either a list of strings specifying the
MIME types for which the plugin is responsible, or more verbose objects
describing those types.  The objects under "mimes" should supply the following
properties:

* "name": identifier for the MIME type
* "suffixes": well-known filename suffixes for the MIME type
* "description": more verbose description for the MIME type

The "meta" object, and each "releases" object, accepts the following properties:

; "pfs_id": an arbitrary ID for the plugin, unique within PFS
; "vendor": name of the vendor responsible for the plugin
; "name": name of the plugin
; "version": version of the plugin
; "os_name": the OS for which the plugin is built, including values such as:
* win

* mac
* mac os x
* ppc mac os x
* intel mac os x
* linux
* linux x86
* linux x86_64
* sunos
* sunos sun4u
; "platform": an object describing the appropriate platform for the plugin:
* "app_id": the application for which the plugin is intended
*** eg. Firefox is {ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}
* "app_release": the release number for the app, eg. 3.5 for Firefox 3.5
* "app_version": the build version of the app, eg. navigator.buildID
